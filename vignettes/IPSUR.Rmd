You are here because you are looking for the source code for `IPSUR`, but it isn't here.  All of the source code for `IPSUR.pdf` can be found in the `/inst/doc` folder of the source package.

To build `IPSUR` yourself, or a modified copy, install the `bookdown` package and start a `New Project...` with `RStudio` in the existing directory of `/inst/doc` as the root folder.  The source code for all chapters is located in the `/inst/doc/Rmd` directory.

# Sample R code

We can run code like the following in an R Markdown file.

```{r}
rnorm(10)
```
